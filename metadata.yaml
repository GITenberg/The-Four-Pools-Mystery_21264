description: It was through the Patterson-Pratt forgery case that I first made the
  acquaintance of Terry Patten, and at the time I should have been more than willing
  to forego the pleasure. Our firm rarely dealt with criminal cases, but the Patterson
  family were long standing clients, and they naturally turned to us when the trouble
  came. Ordinarily, so important a matter would have been put in the hands of one
  of the older men, but it happened that I was the one who had drawn up the will for
  Patterson Senior the night before his suicide, therefore the brunt of the work devolved
  upon me. The most unpleasant part of the whole affair was the notoriety. Could we
  have kept it from the papers, it would not have been so bad, but that was a physical
  impossibility; Terry Patten was on our track, and within a week he had brought down
  upon us every newspaper in New York.
